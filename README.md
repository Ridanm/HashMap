### HashMap

#### A hash map is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. 

#### It is used to perform fast data lookup, insertion, and deletion operations.

#### Uses a hash function to convert the keys into an index (hash code) of the array.

#### El objetivo es distribuir las claves de manera uniforme en toda la matriz, minimizando las colisiones. 

#### Hashing is the process of transforming a given key or string of characters into another value. 
#### The result is usually a shorter, fixed-length value, which makes it computationally easier to work with than the original key.
